# genuary2022

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository is for my first [genuary](https://genuary.art/), a month of generative art. A great opportunity to learn something new coding-wise, while indulging in some artsy activities. I also want to test my [{MexBrewer}](https://paezha.github.io/MexBrewer/) color palettes.

## Day 1: Draw 10,000 of something

5,000 horizontal lines and 5,000 vertical lines.

## Day 2: Dithering

Dithering the Aztec calendar.

Bonus Fridas!

## Day 3: Space

Negative space: Escher mosaics that use the dithering I learned on Day 2.

Detail:

Bonus JosÃ© Guadalupe Posada!

## Day 4: The next next Fidenza

Learning about flow fields with this one.

## Day 5: Destroy a square

I decided to try something minimalist exploiting an effect that I accidentally discovered while learning the Fidenza algorithm.

## Day 6: Trading styles

Not really a trade, more like shamelessly copying some code from [Georgios Karamanis](https://github.com/gkaramanis/aRtist/tree/main/genuary) whose generative art I like (plus, he is generous enough to make his code [public](https://github.com/gkaramanis/aRtist/tree/main/genuary/2021/2021-3)).

This is Frida using the `Frida` palette from [{MexBrewer}](https://paezha.github.io/MexBrewer/).

## Day 7: Sol LeWitt Wall Painting

I did not know Sol LeWitt or his art. He did not believe that the hand that painted was the real artist, but the mind that conceived the painting. He gave instructions and hired drafters to put pencil/brush/whatever to the wall. So this was generative art in analog format: LeWitt gave the algorithm (that was the art) and someone did the painting. [These](https://observer.com/2012/10/here-are-the-instructions-for-sol-lewitts-1971-wall-drawing-for-the-school-of-the-mfa-boston/) are an example of the kind of instructions he used:

> "On a wall surface, any  
> continuous stretch of wall,  
> using a hard pencil, place  
> fifty points at random.  
> The points should be evenly  
> distributed over the area  
> of the wall. All of the  
> points should be connected  
> by straight lines."

For this day I took a number of random points from a planar network and then connected them using, not straight lines, but shortest paths on the network.

## Day 8: Single curve only

A $\Gamma$ function calibrated by [Anastasia Soukhov](https://soukhova.github.io/AccessPack/) using data from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area for commute to work. Color palettes from [{MexBrewer}](https://paezha.github.io/MexBrewer/).

## Day 12: Circle packing

I took some towers from architecture on Day 9 and packed them with circles.

## Day 13: 800x80

Just an excuse to pack more stuff.

![](13-800x80/800x80-2.png)

## Day 15: Sand

Even more circle packing.

## Day 16: Color gradients gone wrong

For this prompt I revisited a machine learning exercise but made it go back in time, and forced a self-organizing map to become self-disorganizing.

## Day 17: Color gradients gone wrong

Each overlapping hatching pattern uses a different color. The hatching patterns were cut using truchet tiles.

## Day 19: Text/typography

For this entry I made some waves using a randomly chose fragment of text from Melville's Moby Dick. 

![](19-text/text-sea-split-sequentially-revolucion.png)

## Day 21: Combine two previous pieces to create something new

Here I combined dithering and text to create this portrait of Melville with text from Moby Dick.

## Day 23: Abstract vegetation

I did not have today to do any original coding, but I was very curious to explore Pierre Casadebaig's [{generate}](https://github.com/picasa/generate) package, so this was a great chance to look into it. These are the results.
